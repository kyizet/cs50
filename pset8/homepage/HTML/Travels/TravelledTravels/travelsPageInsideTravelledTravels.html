						You love hiking? Because it keeps you fit and healthy with much fun. It is located in Hpa An, 279.5km far from Yangon. Buses cannot take you there due to massive muds. You have to take cars in order to get there. But visiting the Karen State can be mesmerizing. But if you're afraid of height, you'll not make it to the top where the Pagoda stands out shining. But if you're not and if you love to do dangerous things, it can also be a good place to take photographs as the mountain offers you climmable rocks around the top of the mountain. You can go with your own car or with Express Bus and Tour Package. Buses travel to Hpa An throughout the day, but there are more options in the morning. For example, the 6am bus will cost 5,000 kyat. From Yangon to Taung Wine Mount the trip will take about 7 to 8 hours.Whether you drive yourself or take the highway bus, here is the route. It will take 7 to 8 hours, so if we start the trip at 9pm we may reach Taung Wine Mountain by 5am. The driving way involves the Yangon - Mandalay highway road to 39 miles, and then we can drive the way to Phayar Gyi Road. Along the way, we will pass Wall City, Kyite Hto City, ThaHton City before arriving to Hpa-An. Once we arrive to Hpa An City, choose Hlaing Bwe Road to go to Taung Wine Mountain. In Hlaing Bwe Road, when you reach Taung Ka Lay you can see the sign for Taung Wine Mount. It will take about 45 minutes to arrive from this point. From the car parking it is about a 7 minutes walk to the mountain, and you will see the steep high-margin stair. From the top it offers a spectacular 360Â° views of the surrounding plains, especially when the air is clear, i.e. in the morning and during wet season. Depending upon how fast you make the journey, it generally takes 1.5 h to walk up the mountain and down again. Bring enough water for the climb and heat.For lunch we recommend the Newton and for Myanmar cuisine Shwe Ma Kyee Pin is the best in town and is located in Hpa An main road. In Shwe Ma Kyee Pin expect to pay about 2500 Kyats for one person with one main curry. You can see the traditional food and snack when you visit the pagoda, all the shop sell very delicious snacks and food. We recommend trying the Maw La Myaing mont hin khar, Wa Ou Salad and Mixed salad. One snack will cost only 500 Kyats. There are lots of other things to do near Taung Win Mountain. If you have time, check out Kaw Ka Thaung Cave, Kayin Palace water spring, Chit Thu Myaing , Mount Zwe Ka Pin , Kyauk Ka Latt and Bayin Nyi Cave. All are within a day trip of Hpa An. In Hpa An, you can buy traditional Kayin dress and other items unique to Kayin state. Also, on the way back to Yangon along Hpa An road there a lot of fresh fruits and snack that are good quality and very cheap.
